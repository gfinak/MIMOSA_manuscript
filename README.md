### The code repository for the MIMOSA manuscript.
The [figures](http://gfinak.github.com/MIMOSA_manuscript/MIMOSA/mimosafigures/manuscriptFigures.html) are on gh-pages.

In the interest of reproducible research, we're making all the code for the data analysis and simulations found in the MIMOSA manuscript, which has been submitted to Biostatistics, available online.  
The knitr document reproduces the figures in the manuscript with the knitrBootstrap package.   
The repository includes that knitr cache and various rds files that save intermediate results, as these can take a considerable amount of time to reproduce from scratch.  

The code is located in MIMOSA_manuscript/MIMOSA/manuscriptfigures/.
The latex code for the manuscript is in MIMOSA_manuscript/.

The latex files for the manuscript itself are also available here.

### Requirements
In order to run the code, you will also need the [SingleCellAssay](http://www.github.com/RGLab/SingleCellAssay) package.
